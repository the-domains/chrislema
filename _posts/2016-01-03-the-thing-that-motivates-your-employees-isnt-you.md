# The thing that motivates your employees isn't you

One of the first memories I have of professional sports is a game my dad took me and my brother to at the Fabulous Forum, home of the LA Lakers (at the time).

We got to watch Pat Riley coach guys like Magic Johnson, Karim Abdul Jabbar, Michael Cooper, and Kurt Rambos. It was amazing.

But what struck me, on that particular evening, was that Pat Riley was pretty calm and quiet on the sidelines, dressed up in his suit.

This was completely different from the coaches I'd played soccer for, growing up. They would dress in sweats, run up and down the field, and participate in every play - yelling from the sidelines.

What then, if not the coach yelling from the sidelines, was motivating his players on the court? The answer is not unique to the 1980's LA Lakers.

**It's a team thing.**

If you watch the first interviews of Michael Jordan after the Bulls won one of their NBA championships, you'll hear him thank the coach, Phil Jackson. 

But if you move to the later interviews - months or years later - and watch people ask him about those championship games, you'll notice the conversations revolve around players, teammates, much more.

That's not just a basketball thing. _It's a team thing._

**Have you ever seen SWAT in action?**

If you've seen enough movies, or been unlucky enough to witness a hostage rescue in person, you know that SWAT isn't like your normal police.

In 1990 I happened to be in Berkeley when a mentally ill man decided to start shooting up a bar and take more than 20 hostages. The first thing that SWAT team did when they arrived was to move us all back - more than a block or two away from Henry's Bar.

Never before, and never since, have I seen such huge guns in person. But the guns aren't what make the SWAT team special. Instead, it's their training.

Even now, twenty five years later, members of that SWAT team educate California police departments on more than the 8 second take-down of the hostage taker. Instead, they talk about the 8 hours of work they did, coordinating among themselves their own efforts, along with the efforts of others.

If you were a young police officer talking to one of those six SWAT operators from the 1990 Berkeley incident, and wanted to know the insider tips on what it takes to become a SWAT officer, you'd likely hear a lot of different answers.

But one answer would be on everyone's list: **teamwork**.

**Teamwork is the motivator**

Whether it's basketball players going for their second or third ring, or SWAT officers trying to navigate a hostage situation, the reality is that they're working together, pushing themselves as hard as they can to get to success.

Team members do that, not just for themselves, but for each other.

Chuck Joyner was employed by the CIA from 1983 to 1987, and was a Special Agent with the FBI from 1987 until his retirement in October 2011\. 

According to Chuck, when the 2 am call out came, and you were more excited about getting a good night's rest rather than responding to the situation and helping your team, that's when you'd know it was time to step away.

Phil Jackson, Pat Riley and Chuck Joyner all understood the same simple truth: _high performers are often motivated less by the people above them and more by the folks standing at their sides._
